      <h1>Bear Tracks</h1>
      <h2>
        The Bear Tracks program provides an extension of classroom activities
        for children who are enrolled in the half-day program. Children who
        attend Bear Tracks are ready for more than half-day classes but
        perhaps not full-day schedules.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Bear Tracks is offered Tuesday through Friday, 9:45 a.m. – 12:30 p.m.,
        for afternoon students and Monday through Friday, 11:45 a.m. – 2:30
        p.m., for morning students. Parents may enroll their children for
        participation in Bear Tracks for any or all days it is offered.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to free choice, outdoor time and a snack, the daily Bear
        Tracks schedule includes a special activity. These activities are
        designed to engage a smaller, multi-age group of children in hands-on
        learning in a specialized content area, such as art, science, movement
        or literacy. Bear Trackers, for example, might take a nature hike one
        day, create an art project the next, or dramatize a story in any
        particular week.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main goal for the Bear Tracks program is to continue the progress
        children are making in their regular classroom within a varied and
        creative curriculum. Children must be toilet-trained to enroll in Bear
        Tracks.

                Colleen Corbett begins her seventh year as a teacher at WUNS,
                teaming for the sixth year with Katie in the Sun Bear classroom. She
                also is the Spanish specialist, teaching once weekly lessons to all
                the classrooms. In addition, Colleen coordinates the morning Bear
                Tracks program and maintains the WUNS website. She worked in the
                student technology and training department for five years at
                Washington University prior to transferring to the nursery school in
                2013.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before coming to Washington University, she taught second grade for
                nine years at The College School. Her degrees include a Bachelor of
                Arts in English, with minors in Spanish, writing, and women’s
                studies, and a Master of Education, both attained from the
                University of Missouri. Additional graduate school hours in early
                childhood education and writing were attained at Webster University
                and Washington University in St. Louis. Her favorite activity with
                the children is sharing literature that connects to experiences in
                the classroom.

                Colleen loves to travel and play in the outdoors with her wonderful,
                over-functioning but humble husband. They live in Webster Groves
                with their fur-daughter, a mutt named Sadie who thinks she’s a
                princess. Their biological daughter is finally launched–she is a
                resident physician at Cincinnati’s Children’s Hospital.

                Suzy Frillman has taught in the early education field since 1996.
                She joined the WUNS staff in 2001. Her undergraduate degree is in
                art education (K – 12) from Missouri State University. She also
                attained a Master of Arts in early childhood education from Webster
                University.
              </p>
              <p>
                Suzy teaches in the Big Bear classroom and is the art specialist at
                WUNS, bringing her passion for teaching art through literature and
                hands-on experiences to the children. She also coordinates the
                afternoon Bear Tracks program. Suzy believes that WUNS is a special
                place to teach because of the diversity of the families and the
                school’s commitment to the developmental needs of the students.
              </p>
              <p>
                She is married to her terrific husband Adam and her lovely daughter
                Sydney (a nursery school alum). Outside of school, Suzy enjoys time
                with her family, taking walks, enjoying nature, making art,
                practicing yoga, and watching Sydney play soccer.

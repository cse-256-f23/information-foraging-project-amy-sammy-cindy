        <h1>Teacher/Parent Conferences</h1>
            <p>Assessment is an ongoing process at WUNS. Teachers interact with children in their play, 
              conversations and observations both in the classrooms and during outdoor play. Teachers keep notes on each child, writing about strengths and weaknesses in all areas of their 
              development. Assessment includes checklists, timelines and examples of the childrenâ€™s 
              writings and pictures. Teaching teams meet weekly to discuss each child and plan activities 
              in their program to enhance needed skills for children. <br>
              The school has two Parent Conferences during the school year. The fall conference is an 
              informal, getting-to-know-the-child-and-family discussion. The spring conference includes a 
              more detailed, written assessment. A parent-teacher conference can be scheduled at any 
              time during the year as needed and by request of parents and/or teachers.

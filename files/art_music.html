      <p>¡Hola! (Hello!) de Señora Colleen (from Miss Colleen)</p>
      <p>
        I am excited to begin my seventh year teaching the Spanish enrichment
        program at WUNS. My philosophy in teaching Spanish is to keep it fun,
        simple and multi-sensory. Whether through song, props, games or
        movement, I like to introduce vocabulary and simple phrases in
        memorable ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once a week I will be visiting each classroom for 15 – 20 minutes for
        songs, games and stories in Spanish. On this website, I will list the
        vocabulary we are learning, the lyrics to a song, and/or an overview
        of lessons. Repetition is key to learning, so I will circle back to
        certain lessons throughout the year for review and recall.

          Each of the classes will have the opportunity to engage in Art
          Enrichment one time per month. We will introduce an Element of Art
          each month and build understanding through conversations and
          experiences in the Art Studio, that may be displayed and later sent
          home with a description of your child’s introduction to that Element
          of Art.

        <p>
          I have had the privilege and honor of teaching Art Enrichment at WUNS
          since 2002. It is a great joy to share my knowledge and passion for
          the Visual Arts with the children! Each and every year I am reminded
          and continually astounded at the beauty, simplicity and sincerity of
          each young Artist’s understandings and renderings of Art from their
          personal perspective. Thank you for sharing your Preschooler with me!

          I am delighted to be leading music classes at WUNS beginning this
          year! I bring experiences as a musician, educator, and parent. I
          taught kindergarten for 12 years, am a certified Music Together
          teacher, have taught flute lessons, and have played in and directed a
          variety of ensembles. I continue to play flute professionally, but I
          have greatly missed the special energy that lights up when I share
          music and movement with young children, who have an innate desire to
          make playful noise and wiggle their bodies. I am very excited to share
          that joy with all the bears at WUNS…including my own little boy who is
          a Big Bear and Sun Bear.

          Each season we will enjoy experimenting with a collection of 15-20
          songs. Some will have words and some won’t. Some will be familiar
          children’s tunes, and some will be pieces from genres such as
          classical, jazz, reggae, folk, and more. For some we will use only our
          voice and bodies to create, and for others we will use percussion
          instruments and props like scarves that help us visualize the beats we
          create. All of our repertoire will give us the opportunity to explore
          tone, rhythm, tempo, dynamics, and expressiveness, and all will be
          fun!

          <p>At Washington University Nursery School we offer children many opportunities to express themselves creatively and artistically. We value visual arts, music, and dramatic play as important building blocks in constructing learning. In the visual arts, the emphasis is on the process of exploring materials and how they can be manipulated, rather than the product of those manipulations. We allow children the time, space, and freedom necessary to achieve a successful and complete experience. These art experiences, whether undertaken independently or as part of a group, can help increase a child’s attention span, improve fine motor skills, strengthen confidence and emotional well-being while building independence. Materials and experiences include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Drawing with crayons, pencils, chalk, markers, sidewalk chalk</li>
          <li>Painting with fingers, brushes, feathers, sponges, leaves, vegetables, and other materials
          and items</li>
          <li>Printmaking with rubber stamps, potato shapes, and various other objects</li>
          <li>Working with clay and doughs used for shaping, building, and modeling</li>
          <li>Cutting, tearing, gluing, and stapling</li>
          <li>Shaping/forming and stringing beads</li>
          <li>Creating collages from any combination of fabrics, paper, pictures, and a variety of three-
          dimensional items</li>
          <li>Building 3-dimensional constructions using boxes, paper tubes, cartons, and other
          recyclable materials</li>
          <li>Creating pictures or structures using wire, clay, wood and other materials</li>

        <h1>Art and Music</h1>
    
        <h2>Visual Arts</h2>
        <h4>At Washington University Nursery School we offer children many opportunities to express themselves creatively and artistically. We value visual arts, music, and dramatic play as important building blocks in constructing learning. In the visual arts, the emphasis is on the process of exploring materials and how they can be manipulated, rather than the product of those manipulations. We allow children the time, space, and freedom necessary to achieve a successful and complete experience. These art experiences, whether undertaken independently or as part of a group, can help increase a child’s attention span, improve fine motor skills, strengthen confidence and emotional well-being while building independence. Materials and experiences include:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Drawing with crayons, pencils, chalk, markers, sidewalk chalk</li>
        <li>Painting with fingers, brushes, feathers, sponges, leaves, vegetables, and other materials
        and items</li>
        <li>Printmaking with rubber stamps, potato shapes, and various other objects</li>
        <li>Working with clay and doughs used for shaping, building, and modeling</li>
        <li>Cutting, tearing, gluing, and stapling</li>
        <li>Shaping/forming and stringing beads</li>
        <li>Creating collages from any combination of fabrics, paper, pictures, and a variety of three-
        dimensional items</li>
        <li>Building 3-dimensional constructions using boxes, paper tubes, cartons, and other
        recyclable materials</li>
        <li>Creating pictures or structures using wire, clay, wood and other materials</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Art with Miss Suzy</h4>

      <a class="download" href="downloads/WUNS-announcement-ART.pdf" target="_blank">Letter from Ms. Suzy about WUNS
        Art Enrichment for School Year
        2019-2020</a><br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of the classes will have the opportunity to engage in Art
      Enrichment one time per month. We will introduce an Element of Art
      each month and build understanding through conversations and
      experiences in the Art Studio, that may be displayed and later sent
      home with a description of your child’s introduction to that Element
      of Art.
    </p>

      I have had the privilege and honor of teaching Art Enrichment at WUNS
      since 2002. It is a great joy to share my knowledge and passion for
      the Visual Arts with the children! Each and every year I am reminded
      and continually astounded at the beauty, simplicity and sincerity of
      each young Artist’s understandings and renderings of Art from their
      personal perspective. Thank you for sharing your Preschooler with me!

    <h4>Music with Ms. Christina</h4>
    <p>
      I am delighted to be leading music classes at WUNS beginning this
      year! I bring experiences as a musician, educator, and parent. I
      taught kindergarten for 12 years, am a certified Music Together
      teacher, have taught flute lessons, and have played in and directed a
      variety of ensembles. I continue to play flute professionally, but I
      have greatly missed the special energy that lights up when I share
      music and movement with young children, who have an innate desire to
      make playful noise and wiggle their bodies. I am very excited to share
      that joy with all the bears at WUNS…including my own little boy who is
      a Big Bear and Sun Bear.

      Each season we will enjoy experimenting with a collection of 15-20
      songs. Some will have words and some won’t. Some will be familiar
      children’s tunes, and some will be pieces from genres such as
      classical, jazz, reggae, folk, and more. For some we will use only our
      voice and bodies to create, and for others we will use percussion
      instruments and props like scarves that help us visualize the beats we
      create. All of our repertoire will give us the opportunity to explore
      tone, rhythm, tempo, dynamics, and expressiveness, and all will be
      fun!

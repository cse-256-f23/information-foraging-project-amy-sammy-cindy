      <h3>Welcome</h3>
      <p>
        Dear Parents and Guardians, 
At the Nursery School we strive to provide a great learning environment for each and every 
child in our care. We recognize that a strong partnership with parents and clarity about 
expectations for how we will work together in this effort are critical. Please take time to read 
through this Parent Handbook and to familiarize yourself with its content. It provides 
important information and helpful guidance. We ask parents to know and follow the 
procedures and rules contained in this Handbook. We hope it will become your go-to source for 
information. </p> 
<p>Nikki Scheele, Director</p>
<p>At Washington University Nursery School, we believe that every child is a unique individual 
with his or her own pattern and timetable for social, emotional, intellectual and physical 
growth. </p> 
<p>We believe in learning through play; we provide fun, child-centered activities that effectively 
engage students. We encourage creativity in all areas with a special focus on the arts to 
enhance language and thinking. Above all, our goals are that children will develop a genuine 
pleasure in learning, that they develop confidence in their ability to learn and to accomplish 
challenging tasks and that they gain experience and skills in interacting with others.
    </p>


    <p>The Washington University Nursery School’s open curriculum framework is presented to 
      children in ways that are developmentally appropriate and based on our philosophy that 
      children learn most effectively through play.  Using a learning center approach, each teaching 
      team offers experiences in art, writing, science, dramatic play, blocks, manipulatives, and 
      literacy.  Teacher planning takes into account the social, emotional, intellectual, and physical 
      developmental needs of the child. </p>

      <h3>Welcome</h3>
      <p>
        Dear Parents and Guardians, 
At the Nursery School we strive to provide a great learning environment for each and every 
child in our care. We recognize that a strong partnership with parents and clarity about 
expectations for how we will work together in this effort are critical. Please take time to read 
through this Parent Handbook and to familiarize yourself with its content. It provides 
important information and helpful guidance. We ask parents to know and follow the 
procedures and rules contained in this Handbook. We hope it will become your go-to source for 
information. </p> 
<p>Nikki Scheele, Director</p>
<p>At Washington University Nursery School, we believe that every child is a unique individual 
with his or her own pattern and timetable for social, emotional, intellectual and physical 
growth. </p> 
<p>We believe in learning through play; we provide fun, child-centered activities that effectively 
engage students. We encourage creativity in all areas with a special focus on the arts to 
enhance language and thinking. Above all, our goals are that children will develop a genuine 
pleasure in learning, that they develop confidence in their ability to learn and to accomplish 
challenging tasks and that they gain experience and skills in interacting with others.
    </p>

    <h3>Philosophy</h3>
    <p>
      Washington University Nursery School teachers are attentive to individual needs, serving as 
catalysts to spark each child’s interests and desire to experiment and explore. Our school 
provides a safe, nurturing environment that encourages growth and independence in all 
developmental areas. </p>
    <p>
      The philosophy of the nursery school is that children learn most effectively through play. Our 
approach is “hands-on,” where children act upon what they are learning and feeling. We 
consider the process more important than the product. Teachers provide the opportunity for 
children to interact with their environment in ways that are meaningful to them. For each 
class, teachers develop a curriculum that reflects the interests and abilities of the children in 
the classroom. In addition, all children actively participate with specialists in science, art, 
music and Spanish. As trends in the field of early education change, we evaluate what is new 
and determine if it would be enriching for our program.
    </p>

    <h3>Vision</h3>
    <p> Washington University Nursery School: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Values children for their wonder and curiosity, their ideas and creativity, and their 
        delight in play. </li>
      <li>Values families for their traditions and goals, their commitment to home, work, play, 
        community, and their dreams for their children. </li>
      <li>Values teachers for their vision, their job in children’s play and achievements, their 
        flexibility and skill, and their commitment and compassion.  We support and respect 
        what we learn from each other.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Parent School Partnership</h3>
    <p>
      When joined by a common set of beliefs and purposes, a school and its parents form a 
powerful team with far-reaching positive effects on children and the entire school 
community. As a result, WUNS relies on its parents to understand and embrace the School’s 
philosophy and values, and fully support its curriculum, teachers/staff, and administration. 
Working together, parents and school professionals exert a strong influence on children’s 
development and help them to mature by modeling healthy adult working relationships 
based on honesty, trust, civility, and mutual respect. The teachers, staff, and administration 
of WUNS share our parents’ commitment to their children and join them in partnership 
dedicated to the growth of each child. This partnership begins with timely, honest and open 
communication between home and school, and is premised on an assumption of goodwill 
and a shared interest in what is best for each individual child. Parents can best support this 
climate of trust and respect by communicating concerns openly and constructively to the 
teacher. If a satisfactory conclusion is not reached, the parent should then contact the 
Director. Out of respect for the individual needs and privacy of each family, the Nursery 
School places a high value on confidentiality and expects individual families to honor the 
same. Efforts to lobby other parents are contrary to the spirit of the Parent School 
Partnership. By enrolling their child(ren) in WUNS, parents agree to support the School’s 
vision, follow its rules and policies, and abide by its decisions. Just as parents can expect the 
Nursery School to share timely information and concerns with families concerning their 
child, so too the Nursery School expects parents to approach issues and concerns in a spirit 
of mutual goodwill, using proper channels, and in a manner that gives everyone the benefit of 
the doubt and leads to collaborative and constructive solutions. While parents may not agree 
with every decision, in most cases, the parents and Nursery School will find enough common 
ground to continue a mutually respectful and productive relationship. However, when it is 
clear that a constructive, positive relationship cannot be maintained, the School reserves the 
right to deny continued attendance or re-enrollment.

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>The Washington University Nursery School was founded in 1947 as a cooperative venture of 
      faculty and Washington University in St. Louis. The primary purpose of the nursery school is 
      to provide the highest quality preschool program for children 2 years and 7 months to 5 
      years of age. Today about 70 percent of the children are from families of Washington 
      University in St. Louis faculty, staff and students, and the remaining are from families in the 
      community. </p>
    <p>Children come from a variety of countries, cultures and economic backgrounds. The school 
      maintains the high standards of the National Association for the Education of Young 
      Children, by which it is accredited. It is licensed by the State of Missouri.</p>
    <p>The nursery school also serves as a site for research in child development. Washington 
      University undergraduate and graduate students are employed to assist in the classrooms. 
      The classroom teachers, as well as the nursery school’s director, supervise them. The student 
      workers’ presence enables children to receive additional individual attention. </p>
    <p>The nursery school is located on the Washington University campus. It is composed of three 
      classrooms, which are designed to offer children a variety of choices in their play. Two 
      additional all-purpose rooms are equipped with a library and a variety of indoor gross motor 
      play materials. A large outdoor play area gives children the opportunity to run, bike, swing, 
      climb, slide and play in the sand.</p>  


    <h3>Staff</h3>  
    <p>The staff at the nursery school respects and appreciates the talents and personalities of each 
      child and his or her family. A teacher’s individual talents are also encouraged as she or he 
      develops his or her own personal approach in the classroom. This makes for a vibrant, 
      growing community of children, families and teachers. </p>
    <p>In general, teachers hold a Bachelor or Master degree in early childhood or elementary 
      education and/or teaching.  All have extensive early childhood teaching experience.  
      (https://nurseryschool.wustl.edu/about/staff/)</p>
    <p>Professional development is an ongoing process at WUNS.  The school pays fees for 
      workshops and conferences during the year.  In addition, there are two teacher in-service 
      days and monthly staff meetings.  All teachers are certified in CPR and First Aid. </p>
    
    <h3>Curriculum</h3>
    <p>At Washington University Nursery School, we believe that children are unique individuals 
      with their own patterns and timetables for social, emotional, intellectual, and physical 
      development.  We support and encourage their development through our child-centered, 
      process-oriented, play-based curriculum built on Constructivist theories and practices.  
      Guided by the teachings of educational theorists including Piaget, Dewey, Vygotsky, DeVries, 
      and others, we create a learning environment that addresses the developmental needs of the 
      whole child by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Structuring classroom experiences around ideas and topics that are relevant to the 
        students, with the understanding that knowledge is constructed through language, 
        discussion, experimentation, and manipulation of objects that are meaningful to 
        them. </li>
      <li>Offering learning experiences that appeal to multiple senses and that provide hands-
        on activities using materials that encourage exploration, investigation, and learning. </li>
      <li>Allowing each child to interact with the environment at his/her own pace, and 
        creating opportunities for children to explore individually, with a partner, or with a 
        larger group of peers. </li>
      <li>Asking open-ended questions, allowing students the time to thoughtfully form 
        responses, listening respectfully to their answers, and gently guiding them toward 
        the answers they seek as they develop enhanced reasoning skills.</li>
      <li>Respecting students’ ideas, encouraging independent thinking, and empowering 
        students to become problem solvers.</li>
      <li>Using the wonderful resource of our diverse, multi-cultural population to highlight 
        the similarities and differences between individuals, families, and cultures, 
        celebrating the unique environment that is Washington University Nursery School. </li>
    </ul> 
    <br>

    <p>The Washington University Nursery School’s open curriculum framework is presented to 
      children in ways that are developmentally appropriate and based on our philosophy that 
      children learn most effectively through play.  Using a learning center approach, each teaching 
      team offers experiences in art, writing, science, dramatic play, blocks, manipulatives, and 
      literacy.  Teacher planning takes into account the social, emotional, intellectual, and physical 
      developmental needs of the child. </p>

          Designed for children ages two and a half to five years, our summer
          camp program includes a wide range of creative indoor and outdoor
          activities, with time to explore and discover, play and make
          friends. Since a good number of hours are spent outside during
          summer camp, the nursery school playground provides opportunities to
          cool off with outdoor water play that includes troughs, sprinklers
          and hoses. Building in the sand and playing on the climbing
          equipment are two other favorite outdoor activities. An adjoining
          wading pool is available for summer campers, whether enrolled in the
          swimming classes or not. Children bring their own lunches. Camp
          provides a morning snack.

        3-Bears Camp is located in the Washington University Nursery School
        facility on the Washington University campus. It is composed of three
        classrooms and an all-purpose room, which are designed to offer
        children a variety of choices in their play. Our large outdoor play
        area gives children the opportunity to run, bike, swing, climb, slide,
        and play in the sand and water.

        Children may take advantage of swimming lessons offered as an optional

            Miriam is thrilled to join the WUNS community this year as a teacher
            in the Bear Cub classroom. Having previously worked with the Bear
            Cubs during summer camp, she is excited to be back at the nursery
            school and working with such a dedicated and warm group of teachers,
            students and families.
          </p>
          <p>
            Miriam attended the University of Colorado-Boulder, where she earned
            BA degrees in Spanish Literature and Elementary Education, as well
            as her MAEd in Curriculum and Instruction with an emphasis on
            Literacy, Language and Culture. She spent seven years teaching
            elementary school in Denver, at a private bilingual school in Mexico
            and with the School District of Clayton.
          </p>
          <p>
            After spending time at home with her three children, Miriam began
            substitute teaching at area preschools and she most recently taught
            preschool at New City School. She loves working with preschool-aged
            children because of their unique opportunity to learn through play,
            creative expression and exploration.
          </p>
          <p>
            Miriam and her husband have two daughters and a son. When she is not
            busy with her family, she loves spending time with friends, reading
            and travelling home to the mountains of Colorado.

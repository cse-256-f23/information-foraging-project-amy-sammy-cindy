      <p>
        I am thrilled to be continuing the Nature on the Move program that has
        been coming to WUNS for 18 years. I believe that one way to preserve
        our natural resources is to teach the youngest members of our society
        to love and respect the natural world around them. Nature on the Move
        allows children to get up close to Missouriâ€™s wildlife and learn how
        each living thing affects the world in which they live. I will visit
        WUNS once per month with a lively presentation on a variety of topics.

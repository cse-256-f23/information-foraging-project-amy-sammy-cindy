        <h1>School Philosphy</h1>
<h2>
    Washington University Nursery School teachers are attentive to
    individual needs, serving as catalysts to spark each child’s interests
    and desire to experiment and explore. Our school provides a safe,
    nurturing environment that encourages growth and independence in all
    developmental areas.
  </h2>
  <p>
    The philosophy of the nursery school is that children learn most
    effectively through play. Our approach is “hands-on,” where children
    act upon what they are learning and feeling. We consider the process
    more important than the product. Teachers provide the opportunity for
    children to interact with their environment in ways that are
    meaningful to them. For each class, teachers develop a curriculum that
    reflects the interests and abilities of the children in the classroom.
    In addition, all children actively participate with specialists in
    science, art, music and Spanish. As trends in the field of early
    education change, we evaluate what is new and determine if it would be
    enriching for our program.
  </p>
  <p>
    The staff at the nursery school respects and appreciates the talents
    and personalities of each child and his or her family. A teacher’s
    individual talents are also encouraged as she or he develops his or
    her own personal approach in the classroom. This makes for a vibrant,
    growing community of children, families and teachers.

  <h3> How Parents Can Live Our Philosophy </h3>

  <p> When joined by a common set of beliefs and purposes, a school and its 
    parents form a powerful team with far-reaching positive effects on children and the 
    entire school community. As a result, WUNS relies on its parents to understand and embrace 
    the School’s philosophy and values, and fully support its curriculum, teachers/staff, and administration. 
    Working together, parents and school professionals exert a strong influence on children’s 
    development and help them to mature by modeling healthy adult working relationships based on honesty, 
    trust, civility, and mutual respect. The teachers, staff, and administration of WUNS share our parents’ 
    commitment to their children and join them in partnership dedicated to the growth of each child. This partnership begins with timely, honest and open communication between home and school, and is premised on an assumption of goodwill and a shared interest in what is best for each individual child. Parents can best support this climate of trust and respect by communicating concerns openly and constructively to the teacher. If a satisfactory conclusion is not reached, the parent should then contact the Director. Out of respect for the individual needs and privacy of each family, the Nursery School places a high value on confidentiality and expects individual families to honor the same. Efforts to lobby other parents are contrary to the spirit of the Parent School Partnership. By enrolling their child(ren) in WUNS, parents agree to support the School’s vision, follow its rules and policies, and abide by its decisions. Just as parents can expect the Nursery School to share timely information and concerns with families concerning their child, so too the Nursery School expects parents to approach issues and concerns in a spirit of mutual goodwill, using proper channels, and in a manner that gives everyone the benefit of the doubt and leads to collaborative and constructive solutions. While parents may not agree with every decision, in most cases, the parents and Nursery School will find enough common ground to continue a mutually respectful and productive relationship. However, when it is clear that a constructive, positive relationship cannot be maintained, the School reserves the right to deny continued attendance or re-enrollment.</p>

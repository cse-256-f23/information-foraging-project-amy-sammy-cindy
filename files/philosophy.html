        <h1>School Philosphy</h1>
<h2>
    Washington University Nursery School teachers are attentive to
    individual needs, serving as catalysts to spark each child’s interests
    and desire to experiment and explore. Our school provides a safe,
    nurturing environment that encourages growth and independence in all
    developmental areas.
  </h2>
  <p>
    The philosophy of the nursery school is that children learn most
    effectively through play. Our approach is “hands-on,” where children
    act upon what they are learning and feeling. We consider the process
    more important than the product. Teachers provide the opportunity for
    children to interact with their environment in ways that are
    meaningful to them. For each class, teachers develop a curriculum that
    reflects the interests and abilities of the children in the classroom.
    In addition, all children actively participate with specialists in
    science, art, music and Spanish. As trends in the field of early
    education change, we evaluate what is new and determine if it would be
    enriching for our program.
  </p>
  <p>
    The staff at the nursery school respects and appreciates the talents
    and personalities of each child and his or her family. A teacher’s
    individual talents are also encouraged as she or he develops his or
    her own personal approach in the classroom. This makes for a vibrant,
    growing community of children, families and teachers.

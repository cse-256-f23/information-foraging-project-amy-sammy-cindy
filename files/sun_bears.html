      <h2>
        The Sun Bear class is the afternoon session for 4- and 5-year old
        children. Classroom activities build on previous learning experiences,
        and children’s interests help drive projects and collaborative play.
        Teachers support each child’s readiness for kindergarten across all
        academic, social and emotional areas.

            learning is fun.
          </li>
          <li>
            Respect themselves and others, focusing on promoting kindness,
            empathy and cooperation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use their natural wonder and curiosity to explore and make
            connections to the world around them.
          </li>
          <li>Think and act more independently.</li>
          <li>Feel successful about their accomplishments, big or small.</li>

                Colleen Corbett begins her seventh year as a teacher at WUNS,
                teaming for the sixth year with Katie in the Sun Bear classroom. She
                also is the Spanish specialist, teaching once weekly lessons to all
                the classrooms. In addition, Colleen coordinates the morning Bear
                Tracks program and maintains the WUNS website. She worked in the
                student technology and training department for five years at
                Washington University prior to transferring to the nursery school in
                2013.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before coming to Washington University, she taught second grade for
                nine years at The College School. Her degrees include a Bachelor of
                Arts in English, with minors in Spanish, writing, and women’s
                studies, and a Master of Education, both attained from the
                University of Missouri. Additional graduate school hours in early
                childhood education and writing were attained at Webster University
                and Washington University in St. Louis. Her favorite activity with
                the children is sharing literature that connects to experiences in
                the classroom.
              </p>

                Colleen loves to travel and play in the outdoors with her wonderful,
                over-functioning but humble husband. They live in Webster Groves
                with their fur-daughter, a mutt named Sadie who thinks she’s a
                princess. Their biological daughter is finally launched–she is a
                resident physician at Cincinnati’s Children’s Hospital.

                Katie is very excited to begin her fifth year at WUNS, in the 2019 –
                2020 school year teaching with Chona in the Teddy Bear classroom
                (mornings) and Colleen in the Sun Bear classroom (afternoons). She
                has taught kindergarten, first and second grades in the Ladue School
                District for many years.
              </p>
              <p>
                She attained her undergraduate degree in elementary education from
                Creighton University and her Master of Arts in teaching early
                education from Webster University. Katie is inspired by young
                children; she is constantly amazed by how they see the joy in simple
                things. One of her goals as a teacher is to provide an enriching
                environment that naturally fosters curiosity, engaging
                conversations, imaginative play, creative movement, and thoughtful
                expression. She believes WUNS is a special place because of its warm
                and welcoming energy and its unique location on a college campus.
              </p>
              <p>
                Katie and her husband Mike are St. Louis natives. They have four
                children, Alli (21), Jake (19), Elizabeth (17) and Will (14) and a
                dog Murphy, “the best West Highland White Terrier ever.” In her free
                time, Katie enjoys hiking, travel, swimming and being with her
                family.

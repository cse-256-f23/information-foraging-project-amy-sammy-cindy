<h3>Vision</h3>
<p> Washington University Nursery School: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Values children for their wonder and curiosity, their ideas and creativity, and their 
    delight in play. </li>
  <li>Values families for their traditions and goals, their commitment to home, work, play, 
    community, and their dreams for their children. </li>
  <li>Values teachers for their vision, their job in children’s play and achievements, their 
    flexibility and skill, and their commitment and compassion.  We support and respect 
    what we learn from each other.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Philosophy</h3>
<p>
  Washington University Nursery School teachers are attentive to individual needs, serving as 
catalysts to spark each child’s interests and desire to experiment and explore. Our school 
provides a safe, nurturing environment that encourages growth and independence in all 
developmental areas. </p>
<p>
  The philosophy of the nursery school is that children learn most effectively through play. Our 
approach is “hands-on,” where children act upon what they are learning and feeling. We 
consider the process more important than the product. Teachers provide the opportunity for 
children to interact with their environment in ways that are meaningful to them. For each 
class, teachers develop a curriculum that reflects the interests and abilities of the children in 
the classroom. In addition, all children actively participate with specialists in science, art, 
music and Spanish. As trends in the field of early education change, we evaluate what is new 
and determine if it would be enriching for our program.
